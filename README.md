# An invisible and robust watermarking scheme using convolutional neural networks
A stylized image is generated by iterating between the style of the host image and the content of a watermark logo added with a timestamp. The stylized image is then encrypted via Arnold transform and is registered in the intellectual property rights as the zero-watermark image. The image copyright is verified using the convolutional neural network.
